# Social-Media-Back-End

This social media app has been created using the following technologies:

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (JS) have been used for the frontend development of the application. SASS has also been used to simplify and organize the stylesheets.

Node.js has been used as the server-side JavaScript runtime environment to build a scalable and efficient web application. Express.js, a popular Node.js framework, has been used to provide routing, middleware, and templating functionalities.

Manual authentication and authentication using Passport.js have been implemented in the application. Passport.js is a middleware for Node.js that provides easy integration with various authentication providers, including Google, Facebook, and Twitter.

Database relations have been established using MongoDB, a flexible NoSQL database that allows easy data structures and scalability. Mongoose, an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB, has been used to manage data relationships and validation.

Social authentication using Passport Google Auth has been implemented to allow users to sign in with their Google account credentials.

Parallel jobs have been run using the mailer tool to send email notifications to users.

A chatting engine using Socket.io has been implemented to facilitate real-time communication between users.

Gulp has been used as a task runner to automate repetitive development tasks, such as minification and bundling of CSS and JS files.

The application has been configured and tested for deployment using AWS (Amazon Web Services), a cloud-based platform for deploying and managing web applications.

To use the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running npm install in the project directory.
3. Set up the MongoDB database and update the connection string in the config folder.
4. Run the application using the command npm start.
5. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000 to access the application.

In conclusion, this social media app has been built using various technologies and provides robust and efficient functionality for users. By using this app, users can communicate in real-time, sign in with their Google account, and receive email notifications. With Gulp and AWS deployment, developers can easily maintain and scale the application.
